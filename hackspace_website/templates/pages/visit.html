<p>If you are interested in joining you can book a free ticket to attend one of our monthly open evenings where you will receive a tour of the space, get a chance to ask any questions you have as well as the option to sign up as a member.</p>
<p>Please use the button below to book your ticket. There is no charge, this is so we know how many people to expect and donâ€™t get overcrowded. To stop tickets from being booked out too far in advance they are only available to book from a week before the open evening.</p>

<p>After the tour you will be given the option to sign up as a member. If you think you may want to sign up on the night please bring photo ID and proof of address (drivers license is fine for both).</p>
<p>Potential members should be aware that joining our community means more than just having access to the Space. We expect all members to contribute to maintaining our facilities and keeping the space clean and organized. If you are not willing to help out and clean up after yourself, then our Hackspace may not be the right fit for you. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to welcoming those who are eager to be an active part of our community.</p>
<p>Please arrive promptly at the time shown on the ticket, if you arrive late you may still be able to have a tour but we cannot guarantee that you would be able to sign up as a member then and there and you may have to return on another open evening.</p>
