        <h2>Membership Payments</h2>
        <p>Please select one of the following payment tiers</p>

        <h3>Supporter Tier</h3>
        <p>If you're able to give more, this level helps strengthen the whole community â€” it not only supports the space but also makes it possible for others to join at the supported rate.</p>
        {{ wtf.input(form.supporter, form) }}

        <h3>Standard Tier</h3>
        <p>This is the level most people choose, and it helps cover the real cost of keeping the space alive and thriving for everyone.</p>
        {{ wtf.input(form.recommended, form) }}

        <h3>Supported Tier</h3>
        <p>This option is here for anyone who might find the standard rate difficult. You're just as much a part of the community, and your membership is made possible thanks to others giving a little extra.</p>
        {{ wtf.input(form.reduced, form) }}

        <p><strong>Please note that as Bristol Hackspace is 100% volunteer run, admin can sometimes take up to a full week or more. Please be patient!</strong></p>
