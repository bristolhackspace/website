<ol start="0">
    <li>
        <p>Don't be on Fire!</p>
        <p>Your safety and the safety of others is your responsibility, so you must always consider the risks and hazards of your actions, and challenge unsafe behaviour in others. Wear appropriate safety gear. Report all incidents.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Pay Monthly Membership.</p>
        <p>To participate in Hackspace and to use Hackspace's stuff, pay a monthly membership fee by bank transfer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Be Excellent to Each-Other.</p>
        <p>Hackspace is an inclusive environment, and we will not tolerate any behaviour that we deem to be harassment, bullying, or discrimination.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Give Back to Hackspace.</p>
        <p>Hackspace doesn't have paid staff and relies on members to keep it clean, safe, and running smoothly. Tidy up after yourself, and give some time back in proportion to the usage you get from the space.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Supervise Guests.</p>
        <p>Guests, visitors, children, and even pets are welcome, but must be supervised by a Hackspace member who accepts responsibility for them.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Do Not Hack Means Do Not Hack.</p>
        <p>Do not hack (or remove) Hackspace's infrastructure and tools, or other member's possessions. Keep your stuff safe from hacking by only storing it in a project box or in the materials rack.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Donate Intelligently.</p>
        <p>Hackspace welcomes donations of quality tools, useful components, and interesting stuff to hack, but not junk.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Be Inducted.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Be Legal.</p>
        <p>Abide by the law when in Hackspace. Do not make controlled substances (such as drugs), illegal items (such as prohibited weapons), or attempt unauthorised access to computer systems (the other type of hacking).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Follow Meridian Studios' Rules Too.</p>
        <p>Hackspace is a tenant of Meridian Studios, so you must follow Meridian's rules on communal areas, waste, and security. Check all doors and windows are locked before you leave Hackspace.</p>
